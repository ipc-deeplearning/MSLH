# MSLH
This is the MSLH project, it is used to reconstruct the shape of particles from the hologram.
This project, includes key procedures and data from experiments and simulations.

data: It contains some data generated by Zernike moment and the mother samples used to generate simulated pollen particles.
In addition, an example data set (experiment and simulation) for SAU-Net training is also included, and a hologram with its mask,
 which with a size of 2048 X 2048, are also provided to verify.

depth_of_field_expension_matlab: It includes the program of depth of field expansion, which is used to reconstruct the shape 
of particles in the hologram by combining the predicted mask.

SAU-Net: It includes SAU-Net model and loss function.

Zernike_program: It contains a procedure for generating simulated particles from parent sample particles using Zernike moments.
